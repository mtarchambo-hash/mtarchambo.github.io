            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hey everyone! My name is Max, and I am a Sophomore studying Computer and Data Science.  
                I am interested in weight lifting, hiking, and video games in my free time. Over break 
                I pretty much just relaxed and took advantage of my parents cooking. When I graduate 
                I hope to pursue a career in the cybersecurity field. </p>
